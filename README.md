This is a backup repository created in case students reach rate limits while querying APIs.

You can replace the link to the API with the link in the repository for the corresponding name.

Example:
Instead of using `requests.get("https://api.nationalize.io/?name=Matt")`, you can now use `requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USC-DSCI-510/lab-10-data-backup/main/nationalities/Matt.txt")`. Please replace the name and API with the corresponding file in this repository.
